# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction with Boosting
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

For this project we will be exploring the dataset of a telecom company and try to predict the customer churn
