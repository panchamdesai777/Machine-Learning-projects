# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals so you canâ€¦ you guessed it,
get more customers!In this assessment, you'll be doing exactly that, albeit with the help of K-Means clustering and observe how you can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behaviour.<br/>

## About the dataset:
We have a dataset consisting of two sheets, with names OfferInformation and Transactions. OfferInformation has 32 rows and 7 columns while Transactions has 324 rows and 3 columns. 
Below given are snapshots of both:

## Approach To Solve The Project:
* Load data from different sources and merge it into a single dataframe
* Create an Offer-Transaction pivot table:
* Use Kmeans to cluster data
segment customers into 5 categories in order to analyse customer behaviour.<br/>
* Visualize clusters using PCA
* Data Minning - Which clusters order the most champagne ?
* Data Minning -  Which cluster of customers favours discounts more on an average?

## Why solve this project ? <br/>
* Data Manipulation
* Dimensionality Reduction Technique with PCA
* KMeans clustering
* Interpreting clusters with visualization
