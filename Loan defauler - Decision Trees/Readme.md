# Loan Defaulter Classification using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Problem Statement
Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.</br>
For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. </br>
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).</br>
As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.The data that we have is from 2007-2010.</br>

## Approach Taken to solve this problem.
* Data loading - The first task is 'surprise' loading the data and see how it looks. Also drop certain columns and split the data for further tasks.<br\>
* Target variable distribution - Plot a bar graph of Target Variable.<br\>
* Feature Split - In this task along with one step of feature engineering, splitting the features based on the data type for visualization purposes.<br\>
* Numerical Features Visualisation - Ploting the relation of numerical features with the target variable.<br\>
* Categorical Features Visualisation - Plotting the relation of categorical features with the target variable.<br\>
* Model Building - Part of decision tree modeling and finding accuracy of model. <br\>
* Decision Tree Pruning - Pruning of decision tree to check if improves its accuracy. Used grid search to do the optimum pruning.<br\>
* Tree visualising - Pruned decision tree visualisation.<br\>

## Learning from the Project.
After completing this project, I now have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model.
In this project, I have applied the following concepts.<br\>
* Train-test split
* Correlation between the features
* Decision Tree Modeling
* Evaluation Metrics
* Graphviz
